# Full-stack Application

SEI Project 2, February 2022

PORTFOLIO SITE:

OVERALL APPROACH TAKEN:
2000s style somewhat professional homepage.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
I used CSS and HTML mainly and a little code of jQuery and Javascript for some button and text appearance effects. I also did both CSS and javascript versions of the inverted picture button effect.

UNSOLVED PROBLEMS:

My layout is a little wobbly and not the greatest in appearance. I ended up doing a media query for a minimum width of around 900px because it looked good on a computer and iPhone screen with a min-width of 500px, but not the tablets.  Maybe there is a better way to do it?

While I eventually figured out how to do dropdown menus using CSS, I first tried to learn various ways of making them via javascript and jQuery, at which I did not succeed, but would someday soon like to learn how to do. (I left my *work-that-didn't-work* commented out at the bottom of my app.js file for your reference).

UPDATE on DROP-DOWNs: It's Monday and I realized they don't work in Safari...I have only checked Firefox and Chrome until now, so am very disappointed/frustrated to realize this on the last day.

Also, although I spent many hours playing with various color palettes, layouts, images, etc., I am not satisfied with the general appearance at all. It looks so simple and not very professional...a total "newb" vibe going on.

Finally, not a problem, just a point of lack of completeness, but the content was kind of thrown together due to lack of time.  My resume, in particular, is very rough.

FINAL COMMENT:
This was a very useful project for my classmates and me, and I wish I could do more with it before presentation day, but this project unfortunately coincided with the week all 10 of my college courses's grades were due, so this portfolio is really just meeting the minimum requirements at this point.  I hope to continue to embellish and expand on this project (and also make it more professional looking and aesthetically pleasing) in coming months because I think it is a good way to advertise myself to potential employers.
