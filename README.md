# Full-stack Application

SEI Project 2, February 2022


APP URL: https://rewardplease.herokuapp.com/

OVERALL APPROACH TAKEN:
An app for kids to get rewarded for being helpful around the house and in general trying to be more independent each day. They log such activities/chores and accrue points based on the minutes they work.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
express, mongoose, partials, flexbox, javascript... There is no seed file because the data is all user-generated.


UNSOLVED PROBLEMS:
Right now it is just an app for one child (my child). In order for others to use it, I need to get login capability set-up, as well as user-schema association so that each user (only) has access to their own data collection.


FINAL COMMENT:
My app is really simple, but for the most part accomplishes the goal I set out to achieve.  It is already being used and enjoyed by my daughter, and the physical whiteboard and paper being used for such a purpose in the past is no longer necessary, so that is a success in my book.
